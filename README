A ColdFusion function to create tinyMCE instances - supports compression and multiple instances per page.
It's a pretty good base with decent defaults. For more information visit http://www.webveteran.com/blog/index.php/cf-tinymce/

USAGE

To display an RTE instance filled with bio information from a query named 'read':

<cfoutput>
#application.formutils.tinymce(
	VScope=Variables,
	element='bio',
	content=read.bio,
	csswidth='600px'
)#
</cfoutput>

This assumes you cached the CFC into an application variable called formutils.
